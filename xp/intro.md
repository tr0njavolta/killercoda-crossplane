# Welcome to Crossplane with LocalStack

In this scenario, you'll learn how to use Crossplane to manage cloud infrastructure as Kubernetes resources.

## What is Crossplane?

Crossplane is an open-source Kubernetes extension that transforms your cluster into a universal control plane. It allows you to manage cloud infrastructure and services using Kubernetes-style APIs.

## What You'll Learn

- Install Crossplane in a Kubernetes cluster
- Set up LocalStack as a local AWS environment
- Configure the AWS Provider for Crossplane
- Create and manage AWS resources (S3 bucket) through Kubernetes manifests

## Why LocalStack?

LocalStack provides a local AWS cloud stack, allowing you to develop and test cloud applications without incurring AWS costs. Perfect for learning Crossplane!

## Setup

The environment is being prepared automatically. This includes:
- Installing Helm
- Installing Crossplane
- Deploying LocalStack (AWS simulator)
- Installing and configuring the AWS S3 Provider
- Creating all necessary credentials and configurations

**This takes about 3-5 minutes.** Once you see "✅ Setup Complete!" you're ready to go!
